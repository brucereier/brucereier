## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bruce, a junior at UNC Chapel Hill studying Computer Science and Mathematics. Most of my experience is in Full Stack development, specifically in .NET and React, but I try to stay involved in a gamut of tech topics and am open to collaborate on any cool projects. Outside of developing, I enjoy weightlifting, reading, writing, and Chicago Sports(Go Bears and Cubs!). 

## I'm currently working on
- Research into developing a Machine Learning pipeline to determine whether Whole Slide Images are cancerous or benign
- classmate, a website on which students can plan their schedules and connect with friends
- Luminary, an iOS app that provides accessible navigation on college campuses

Feel free to check out some of my work [here](https://brucereier.dev).
